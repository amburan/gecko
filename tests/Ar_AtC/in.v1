#AtC Thermal Coupling
# This benchmark tests heat conducting into and out of the MD region.  The
# temperature is intially 20 everywhere and the left boundary BC is fixed at
# 40.# The result should show heat diffusing through the FEM to the MD and back
# out # to the FEM on the right.  Insufficient time is captured to reach the
# linear # steady state, but heat crossing both boundaries should be observed.
